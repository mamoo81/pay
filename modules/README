Modules are the main way for Flowee Pay to extend the user interface
beyond the basics that all users will want.

It is currently only supported in the mobile 'skin' due to the simple
fact that the desktop one is unofficially meant for the developers and
its Ok to have all features enabled in there by default.
Additionally it avoids modules needing to support multiple form-factors.

How to create a new module:

start by copying the example module. Taking care that the base name of
the new module is defined by the directory. Please use all-lowercase for
your directory name!

Adjust the CMake file and replace the project and library names by
replacing the 'example' word with your project name.
Notice that this is case sensitive and dashes and underscores are
different characters here.

Your lib will be [dirname]_module_lib.
So if your dir name is "hello-world" your lib name is "hello-world_module_lib.


**Next** you need a ModuleInfo class. Any class ending with that name is Ok,
please use CamelCase for your filename and your class names.

The class will have a build() method which you need to implement in order
to get your module to be used by Flowee Pay. Exactly one ModuleInfo and
a minimum of one ModuleSection is useful to get anything visual.

**QML dirs** all QML files are expected to be added in the qrc file because
that will cause them to be included in the finished executable.
Due to the way that cmake works it is required that the qrc file has a
unique name, so please prefix the module name to avoid any conflicts.

The 'qrc' system is a virtual file system and modules should have their own
unique subdirectory. This subdirectory is defined in your qrc file.
In the QRC file you can find a tag like this, it specifies your qrc subdir.
    <qresource prefix="/my-module-name">

In order to reuse the QML classes from the rest of the project you can 
import them like such:

import "../Flowee" as Flowee
import "../mobile"

These imports map directly to the guis/mobile and guis/Flowee directories
in the global Flowee Pay project repository.

Feel free to make some symlinks to help autocomplete in QtCreator, just please
don't commit them.


**Buildsystem** the build-system will automatically detect a new module
without any need to alter anything outside of the module directory you are
creating. This is intended to avoid merge conflicts if there are multiple
modules being prepared for inclusion at the same time.
