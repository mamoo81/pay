This is the repository of Flowee Pay.

Flowee Pay is a payment solution, also often called wallet, that allows
users to pay and receive Bitcoin Cash in a simple application with little
to no external parties we need to depend on.
The only really required dependent is the peer to peer network, and thus
the Internet.

We use QML for the user interface, which allows fast turnaround for
skinning and a very strong model/view separation. The goal here is to have
multiple user interfaces for the one codebase. For instance you can have
a very different user experience and set of features on desktop than on
Android. You can simply "skin" an existing GUI and change it to have your
companies logo (we want you to do that! Just please use a different name
for the app you ship then!)


The goal of having a Free Software product like Flowee Pay is that average
users can use the community client and when companies that want to bundle a
wallet with their product (for instance to do some token thingy) they are
more than welcome to provide their own skinning instead of the ones that
are included in this repo.

Any companies or groups doing this are going to help increase the quality
of the main free software product and thus this benefits all.


BUILDING

Flowee Pay uses libraries from Flowee, you need to
either install the main flowee package via your package manager
or compile it before you compile Pay.
The minimum version required for the Flowee libraries is 2020.07.1

You need cmake and Qt5. When you have those installed it is just a matter
of calling:

```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
```

If you compile Flowee the Hub yourself you may want to export the
following variable in case the build wasn't found in the 'cmake' line above.
  export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/the/flowee-build
followed with again the call to cmake and make like above.
